		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>
			Hi, my name is Sahel Mohammad Iqbal. Perhaps the only relevant thing that you need to know about me in the context of this website is that I'm a believer in a whole host of values that seem to be fast going out of fashion throughout the world, including but not limited to the freedoms of speech, expression and religion. Just for completion, I'm a student at NISER, Bhubaneswar, and I hail from Kerala.

		<span>Why the weird website address?</span>
		<p>Being a student, I can't afford to pay for website hosting. This website is hosted for free by <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, which explains why you probably haven't seen this kind of an address before.</p>
