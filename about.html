		<h3>About the Website</h3>
		<p>
			In most discussions on politics and humanitarian issues, the people who are involved are almost always middle-aged or older. Granted, they are the 'responsible' men and women, but college and school students are an important demographic that doesn't get adequate representation on such discussion platforms. I personally would like to know what people my age are thinking about the issues in India and in the world, especially in this particular time when our core values as a country are being attacked. This website is meant as a venue for students to air their opinions and grievances about relevant social issues, and to let their peers across India know about the problems / initiatives at their own institutes.

		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>
			My name is Sahel Mohammad Iqbal and I'm a student at NISER, Bhubaneswar. The only relevant introduction needed here is that I'm a believer in <a href="https://secure.mygov.in/read-the-preamble-india/" target="_blank">a whole host of values</a> that seem to be fast going out of fashion throughout the world in general, and in India in particular, with a special emphasis on equality and the freedom of speech and expression.

		<span><small>Why the name?</small></span>
		<p>The name of the website is inspired by the concept of a neighborhood watch, which is a group of people looking out for their own neighborhood. The Student Watch doesn't strictly adhere to a similar meaning, because I would like it to stand for a group that not just looks out for the interest of the students, but for that of the nation (and perhaps even the world) as a whole.</p>

		<span><small>Why the weird website address?</small></span>
		<p>Being a student, I can't afford to pay for website hosting. This website is hosted for free by <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, which explains why you probably haven't seen this kind of an address before.</p>
